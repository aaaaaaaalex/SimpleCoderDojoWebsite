			<h2>Coding with CIT-Dojo as a Senior</h2>
			<p class="left">Teenagers in the Seniors' Club will be introduced to programming with Python and Unity 3D, two powerful tools that are used extensively worldwide.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.python.org/" target = "blank">Python</a>, a scripting language like PHP and Perl, can be used in Web Development but can also be used to make applications, such as the popular 3D-Modelling engine Blender</p>
			<p><a href="https://unity3d.com" target = "blank">Unity 3D</a>, on the other hand delves further into the world of 3D computer gaming. Rather than being it's own programming language, it is a 3D program designed for making and learning about 3D games and object-oriented scripts. To do so , it utilizes the power of other scripting languages such a JavaScript, C-Sharpe and Boo</p>
